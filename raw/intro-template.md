## 1. The MAGRAM database in CrossGram

The **MAGRAM database** provides information about **992 grammaticalization paths** from more than a hundred different languages. MAGRAM stands for [MAinz GRAMmaticalization project](https://en.magram.fb05.uni-mainz.de/). See §4 below for the history of the database.

Each grammaticalization path consists of a ***target gram***, and a corresponding ***source form*** (e.g. the English target gram *will* (future tense), deriving from the source form Old English *willan* ‘want’).

The target grams are given in the **Constructions** tab with the gram’s functional description as the construction name and the gram’s form (orthographic or phonological shape) in the *Description* column. Each target gram is illustrated by one example, which can also be viewed in the **Examples** tab. When clicking on an individual construction (labeled “Gram: …”), the full details of the individual grammaticalization path are displayed, including the evaluation of the grammaticalization parameters (as explained below).

The source forms are treated as parameter values of the constructions. In the **C-Parameters** tab, one can click on the **Source form** parameter to obtain a list of all 992 paths. In this list, the target form is in the *Construction* column, the functional description of the source form is treated as the *Value*, and the shape of the source form can be found in *Comments*. In addition to the source forms, the **C-Parameters** tab gives information on the *Meaning type* of each target gram, and on the ***grammaticalization parameters***.

The **L-Parameters** tab also provides an overview of the *Meaning types* of the target grams with a brief explanation of the label in *Description* as well as the number of instances from this group in *Representation*. With a click on a specific *Meaning type*, one is provided with a map showing the geographical spread of grammaticalization paths from this group.

## 2. Grammaticalization parameters

The eight grammaticalization parameters in MAGRAM are:

– Semantic integrity
– Phonetic reduction
– Paradigmaticity
– Bondedness
– Paradigmatic variability
– Syntagmatic variability
– Decategorization
– Allomorphy

In the database, each parameter is coded for the ***path*** (from source to target) and for the ***target form***. For the path, the database records whether there is a change or not (*yes* or *no*). For the target form, the database records the ***degree of grammaticalization*** on a scale between 1 (least grammaticalized) and 4 (most grammaticalized). For each of the eight parameters, the scales are different, as described in the C-Parameter description field and in the [Documentation](https://zenodo.org/records/18432423).

## 4. History and development of the MAGRAM project

MAGRAM, the [MAinz GRAMmaticalization project](https://en.magram.fb05.uni-mainz.de/), was funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG; BI 591/12-1) and conducted at the Johannes Gutenberg Universität Mainz under the leadership of [Walter Bisang](https://www.linguistik.fb05.uni-mainz.de/mitarbeiter/walter-bisang/) and [Andrej Malchukov](https://www.linguistik.fb05.uni-mainz.de/mitarbeiter/andrej-malchukov/), from January 2016 through March 2020.

MAGRAM began with the hypothesis that grammaticalization is not necessarily cross-linguistically homogeneous (cf. Bisang 2011). The project explored areal and/or cross-phylogenetic variation based on two key hypotheses:

1. Grammaticalization paths of the type [SOURCE → TARGET] vary areally/genetically in terms of both the sources and targets associated with specific concepts.

2. There are cross-linguistic differences in the degree of covariation of meaning and form – semantic changes do not always imply form-related changes.

A major outcome of MAGRAM was the two-volume work [Grammaticalization scenarios: Cross-linguistic variation and universal tendencies](https://www.degruyter.com/serial/grasc-b/html), which includes:

– a position paper (Bisang et al. 2020a),
– a methodology paper (Bisang et al. 2020b), and
– 25 detailed studies on grammaticalization scenarios across languages and areas.

The core team of MAGRAM consisted of
– [**Walter Bisang**](https://www.linguistik.fb05.uni-mainz.de/mitarbeiter/walter-bisang/) (WB) – Principal Investigator
– [**Andrej L. Malchukov**](https://www.linguistik.fb05.uni-mainz.de/mitarbeiter/andrej-malchukov/) (AM) – Principal Investigator
– [**Linlin Sun**](https://www.linguistik.fb05.uni-mainz.de/mitarbeiter/linlin-sun/) (LS) – annotation and evaluation
– [**Iris Rieder**](https://magram.fb05.uni-mainz.de/iris-rieder/) (IR) – annotation and evaluation
– [**Eduard Schroeder**](https://magram.fb05.uni-mainz.de/eduard-schroeder/) (ES) – annotation and evaluation
– [**Marvin Martiny**](https://magram.fb05.uni-mainz.de/marvin-martiny/) (MM) – annotation and evaluation, database curation
