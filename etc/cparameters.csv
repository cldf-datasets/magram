target-meaning-type,Target:Label_Group,Meaning type of target grams,"One of the types agreement, aspect, conjunction, definiteness, evidential, modality, number, tense, … and “other”."
source,Source:Meaning,Source form,"The value of this parameter is the source form (its description and its shape in the Comment field), so that the 1992 entries in the table here are the 992 grammaticalization paths of the database."
value-semantic-integrity,value:semantic_integrity,Semantic integrity: Target value,This parameter concerns the scale from lexical meaning (1) via abstract denotational (2) and abstract relational meaning (3) to purely syntactic function (4).
value-phonetic-reduction,value:phonetic_reduction,Phonetic reduction: Target value,This parameter concerns the scale from two or more syllables (1) via monosyllabic forms (2) and subsyllabic morphs (3) to suprasegmental feature or loss (4).
value-paradigmaticity,value:paradigmaticity,Paradigmaticity: Target value,This parameter concerns the scale from major (open) word class (1) via minor (closed) word class (2) to a grammatical category that is not fully paradigmatic (3) and a small and homogeneous paradigm (4).
value-bondedness,value:bondedness,Bondedness: Target value,"This parameter measures the degree of cohesion/fusion between the host and the grammaticalizing element, from lexical root or free morph (1) via clitic (2) to agglutinative affix (3) and process morpheme or part of portmanteau or zero (4)."
value-paradigmatic-variability,value:paradigmatic_variability,Paradigmatic variability: Target value,This parameter measures the degree of obligatoriness from freedom of ocurrence (1) via restricted obligatoriness (2) to predominant obligatoriness (3) and general obligatoriness (4).
value-syntagmatic-variability,value:syntagmatic_variability,Syntagmatic variability: Target value,"This parameter measures the ease with which an item can be shifted around in its context, from free word order (1) via more constrained position (2) to intransparent position (3) and fixed position in a template (4)."
value-decategorization,value:decategorization,Decategorization: Target value,This parameter concerns the scale from no change in categorial properties (1) via partial absence of some properties (2) to absence of most properties (3) and total decategorization (4).
value-allomorphy,value:allomorphy,Allomorphy: Target value,This parameter concerns the scale from no allomorphy (1) via moderate (phonologically conditioned) allomorphy (2) to morphologically conditioned allomorphy (3) and lexically conditioned allomorphy (4).
